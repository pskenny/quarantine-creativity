Keep the lights off for me
<br/>I'm in no hurry home
<br/>I dissolve through the streets
<br/>Dont even know how far I've gone
<br/>
<br/>I keep a watchful eye on the man at my back
<br/>His cool weightless form
<br/>I think I'm going to crack
<br/>
<br/>I'm a self contained, self destroyer
<br/>Box without a lid
<br/>My hurt is so simple
<br/>But the reasons have hid
<br/>
<br/>I feel the cold, heavy rays
<br/>They claw at my skin
<br/>Had these anxious desires
<br/>Since the original sin
<br/>
<br/>Hear the heat of silence
<br/>The same electric hum
<br/>I cant come back now
<br/>No matter how fast I run
